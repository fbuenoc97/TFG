This work aims to experimentally quantify the attack detection level of some of the freely available signature-based intrusion detectors (SIDS). For its evaluation, a dataset of attacks generated from the search and selection of tools for generating attacks and security analysis of the web service has been used. Two scenarios of different complexity are considered in terms of the web service provided. The HTTP requests recorded during the attacks will be the input to three free SIDS selected for their wide use, so that their detection capacity can be determined.The detailed description of the development of the study is available in the PDF memory of the repository.
