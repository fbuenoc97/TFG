This repository includes screenshots of attack web traffic generated by leading opensource vulnerability scanning tools, and a few commercial ones.
This traffic has been generated against a dynamic web page and a static one to check the differences that this traffic presents.
The captures are organized according to the web against which these attacks have been launched, and within each web according to the tools that have launched them. Within each tool, we will find 4 types of files with different extensions:
-pcap: Capture type pcap of all generated traffic
-csv: Capture organized by columns with all http headers
-uri: File that contains all the uris launched in the attack
-ipfix: Netflow-type capture of generated traffic.

For most of the tools, a single complete capture of its use has been made, however, there are several of them where attacks have been generated with various plugins/modules/scripts, then for these tools, we have a capture for each attack, saving said capture with the same nomenclature of the type of attack that the tool carried out.
